# cot-4500-as3b

The following repository will consist of methods that deal with matrices including Gaussian Elimination w/ Backward Selection and LU Factorization

In addition, we are looking for whether or not the matrix is diagonally dominant and/or positive definite

    The code is done on Python 3.11 on Eclipse, uploaded to Github
    To run the script: python test_assignment_3.py (this is where all the test cases are)
    You may view the files uploaded to run the code for validity
    Packages: sys, os, numpy

Gaussian Elimination is basically doing row-reduction into echelon form; this goes in-hand with backwards selection

LU Factorization simplifies a matrix into L and U product; L is lower triangular matrix and U is upper triangular matrix

Diagonally Dominant: if the absolute value of the values in diagonal are greater than or equal to the other row values, it's diagonally dominant

Positive Definite: If all eigenvalues are positive (greater than 0), then it's positive definite

All methods are demonstrated within each function under assignment_3.py and all test matrices will be used under test_assignment_3.py

**NOTE** Please be sure that the following .py files are under repository: **cot-4500-as3b** as all functions/methods should be under that specific repository
